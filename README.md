If using this repository in your own research, please e-mail me to cite my work (the paper to cite is yet to be published).

This repository is part of my PhD. It contains the code and files for batch segmentation of point clouds.

You require CGAL to run my code.
The easiest way is to run my script easy_install.sh. It will install CGAL and compile my code for you.

After installating and compiling you can run demo.sh ad it will segment the demo point cloud that goes with the repository.

My code accepts --help and --verbose. I hope this helps you.


Good segmenting! :)
